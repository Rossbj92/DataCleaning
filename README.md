## Overview
This repository contains several different notebooks using Python's Pandas library to clean and prepare data for analysis or other practical uses. 
## Notebooks
##### **Anonymizing SONA IDs**
Takes identifiable students' information and trims each ID for a public gradebook
##### **app_data_concatenation**
Functions that read in CSV files from two mobile applications: Moment and Instant. Various methods such as transposition reformat the data to index by User ID, compose columns with relevent data, and standardize both apps' data to be able to merge into one master sheet. 
##### **credit_script**
Used for several longitudinal studies, this takes participants' emails (fake emails present in notebook) and tallies entries to return the amount of credits each participant will receive.
